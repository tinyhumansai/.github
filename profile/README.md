# Welcome to TinyHuman

TinyHumans is an AI lab focused on creating AI algorithims that scale with big amounts of data at low cheap costs. See our work

- [NeoCortex Mk1](https://github.com/tinyhumansai/neocortex/tree/main/mk1-2026-02) - A realtime LLM with built-in memory to understand context at massive scale with dirty cheap costs.
- [AlphaHuman](https://github.com/tinyhumansai/alphahuman) - An opensource (GNU) AI agent protocol that uses NeoCortex to execute tasks and consume real-time intelligence.
